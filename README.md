  - These datasets were created to have an equal number of faces and follow a manifold format.

# Usage
- Preprocessing: python resize_manifold.py && python make_dataset.py
- Train the model: python trainer.py
- Explain: python Grad-CAM.py

code description

- resize_manifold.py
  - Make it follow the manifold format and have the same number of faces.
- make_dataset.py
  - It transforms into the data structure suggested in the paper to efficiently conduct learning and testing.
- trainer.py
  - Train the model.
- Grad-CAM.py
  - Describe the model using the GradCAM method.

Hyperparameters are defined in the code.

For proper testing, hyperparameters of each file must be modified.
